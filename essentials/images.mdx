## Adding Images

You can add images using markdown syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](/path/to/image.png)
```

Or using HTML:

```html
<img src="/path/to/image.png" alt="Alt text" />
```

## Image Optimization

Images are automatically optimized by Mintlify for better performance.

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive alt text
- Optimize images before uploading
- Use appropriate file formats (PNG for graphics, JPG for photos)
- Keep file sizes reasonable
