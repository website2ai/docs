## Deletion Process

When you delete a project, the system:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Ownership">
    Confirms the authenticated user owns the project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete Database Records">
    Removes all versions, files, and messages from PostgreSQL
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete File Storage">
    Removes all file content from R2 storage
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Returns success response
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Before Deletion

1. **Export Important Data**: Download files you may need later
2. **Check Version History**: Review all versions to ensure you're not deleting needed work
3. **Confirm with User**: Always confirm deletion in your UI

### Safe Deletion Pattern

```javascript
// 1. Get project details first
const project = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:8000/v1/websites/${baseId}`,
  { headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' } }
).then(r => r.json());

// 2. Show confirmation with project details
const confirmed = confirm(
  `Delete "${project.title}" (${project.version} versions)? ` +
  `This cannot be undone.`
);

if (!confirmed) return;

// 3. Perform deletion
const response = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:8000/v1/websites/${baseId}`,
  {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' }
  }
);

if (response.ok) {
  console.log('Project deleted successfully');
  // Redirect or update UI
} else {
  console.error('Deletion failed');
}
```

## Error Responses

### 404 Not Found

```json
{
  "detail": "Website project not found"
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized

```json
{
  "detail": "Could not validate credentials"
}
```

### 403 Forbidden

```json
{
  "detail": "You do not have permission to delete this project"
}
```

## Alternative: Soft Delete

If you want to implement soft delete (mark as deleted without removing data), you'll need to add a custom field to your application layer. The API currently only supports hard delete.
