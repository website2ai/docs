# Getting Started

Create your first website with Hando in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Hando account — [Sign up](https://hando.dev) with Google
- Credits in your account (new users receive free credits)

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Open the Builder

Go to [hando.dev/builder](https://hando.dev/builder) to access the website builder.

### Step 2: Describe Your Website

In the chat panel, describe the website you want. Include:

- **Purpose** — What is it for?
- **Style** — Modern, minimal, bold, playful?
- **Sections** — Hero, features, pricing, contact?
- **Colors** — Any brand colors or preferences?

**Example prompt:**

```
Create a landing page for a task management app called "TaskFlow".

Include:
- Hero section with headline, description, and "Get Started" button
- Features section with 3 cards showing key benefits
- Pricing section with Free and Pro tiers
- FAQ section with 5 common questions
- Footer with links and newsletter signup

Style: Modern, clean, lots of white space
Colors: Blue (#3B82F6) as primary color
```

### Step 3: Watch It Build

After submitting, you'll see:

1. **Progress indicators** — Files being created in real-time
2. **Live preview** — Your website appearing in the preview panel
3. **Build status** — Compilation progress

Generation typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on complexity.

### Step 4: Refine with Chat

Not quite right? Chat with the AI to make changes:

```
Make the hero section taller and add a background gradient
```

```
Change the primary color to purple
```

```
Add a testimonials section with 3 customer quotes
```

Version history with restore functionality is coming soon.

### Step 5: Share Your Website

Your website is automatically deployed at:

```
https://your-project.hando.dev
```

Share this URL immediately, or [connect a custom domain](/custom-domains) (Pro plan).

## Understanding the Interface

### Chat Panel (Left)

Your conversation with the AI:

- **Create** — Describe new websites
- **Modify** — Request changes to existing sites
- **Ask** — Get help understanding your project

### Preview Panel (Center)

Live preview of your website:

- **Desktop/Mobile toggle** — Check responsive design
- **Refresh** — Reload the preview
- **Open in new tab** — Full-screen preview

### Code Panel (Right)

View and edit source code:

- **File tree** — Navigate project files
- **Editor** — Syntax-highlighted code
- **Toggle** — Show/hide code panel

## Writing Good Prompts

### Be Specific

**Less effective:**
```
Make me a website
```

**More effective:**
```
Create a portfolio website for a photographer.
Include a hero with my name, a gallery grid of 12 photos,
an about section, and a contact form.
Use a dark theme with white text.
```

### Describe Structure

List the sections you want:

```
Create a SaaS landing page with:
1. Hero with headline and email signup
2. Logo bar showing client companies
3. 3 feature cards with icons
4. Testimonial carousel
5. Pricing table (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
6. FAQ accordion
7. Footer with links
```

### Specify Style

Include visual preferences:

```
Style:
- Minimalist and clean
- Rounded corners on all elements
- Subtle shadows
- Sans-serif fonts
- Primary color: #10B981 (green)
```

## Credit Usage

Credits are consumed based on the complexity of your request. Simple changes cost less, while full page generation costs more.

**Tips to save credits:**
- Be specific to reduce back-and-forth
- Make focused, single changes
- Use your daily credits for experimentation
