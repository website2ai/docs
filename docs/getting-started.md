# Getting Started

Create your first website with Website2AI in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Website2AI account — [Sign up](https://website2.ai) with Google
- Credits in your account (new users receive free credits)

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Open the Builder

Go to [website2.ai/builder](https://website2.ai/builder) to access the website builder.

### Step 2: Describe Your Website

In the chat panel, describe the website you want. Include:

- **Purpose** — What is it for?
- **Style** — Modern, minimal, bold, playful?
- **Sections** — Hero, features, pricing, contact?
- **Colors** — Any brand colors or preferences?

**Example prompt:**

```
Create a landing page for a task management app called "TaskFlow".

Include:
- Hero section with headline, description, and "Get Started" button
- Features section with 3 cards showing key benefits
- Pricing section with Free and Pro tiers
- FAQ section with 5 common questions
- Footer with links and newsletter signup

Style: Modern, clean, lots of white space
Colors: Blue (#3B82F6) as primary color
```

### Step 3: Watch It Build

After submitting, you'll see:

1. **Progress indicators** — Files being created in real-time
2. **Live preview** — Your website appearing in the preview panel
3. **Build status** — Compilation progress

Generation typically takes 1-3 minutes depending on complexity.

### Step 4: Refine with Chat

Not quite right? Chat with the AI to make changes:

```
Make the hero section taller and add a background gradient
```

```
Change the primary color to purple
```

```
Add a testimonials section with 3 customer quotes
```

Each change creates a new version. You can always go back to previous versions.

### Step 5: Share Your Website

Your website is automatically deployed at:

```
https://your-project.website2.ai
```

Share this URL immediately, or [connect a custom domain](/custom-domains) (Pro plan).

## Understanding the Interface

## Writing Good Prompts

### Be Specific

**Less effective:**

```

**More effective:**
```

Include a hero with my name, a gallery grid of 12 photos,
an about section, and a contact form.
Use a dark theme with white text.
```

### Describe Structure

List the sections you want:

```
Create a SaaS landing page with:
1. Hero with headline and email signup
2. Logo bar showing client companies
3. 3 feature cards with icons
4. Testimonial carousel
5. Pricing table (Free, Pro, Enterprise)
6. FAQ accordion
7. Footer with links
```

### Specify Style

Include visual preferences:

```
Style:
- Minimalist and clean

- Subtle shadows
- Sans-serif fonts
- Primary color: #10B981 (green)
```
