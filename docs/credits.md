# Credits

Credits are the currency for generating and modifying websites on Website2AI.

## How Credits Work

Credits are consumed based on AI usage. The cost varies depending on:

- **Complexity** — Simple text changes cost less than full page generation
- **AI model** — Different models have different costs
- **Image generation** — AI-generated images cost additional credits
- **Token usage** — More complex prompts and outputs use more credits

## Credit Types

Website2AI has two types of credits:

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Monthly Credits** | Granted monthly to Pro subscribers. Unused credits carry over for 1 month. |
| **Daily Credits** | Expire after 24 hours. Refreshed daily at midnight UTC. |

**Usage priority:** Credits are consumed in order of expiration date, starting with the earliest.

## Managing Credits

### Check Your Balance

1. Click your profile icon in the top right
2. Select **Account** or open the subscription modal
3. View your current balance in the **Credits** tab

### View Transaction History

In the Credits tab, you'll see:

- **Transaction type** - charge (purchase), usage, or bonus
- **Amount** - positive for credits received, negative for usage
- **Description** - what the credits were used for
- **Date** - when the transaction occurred

### Credit Refresh Schedule

| Credit Type | When |
|-------------|------|
| Daily credits | Every day at 00:00 UTC |
| Monthly credits (Pro) | Billing date each month |

**Note:** Unused daily credits expire at midnight UTC.

## Tips to Optimize Credit Usage

Get more from your credits:

- **Be specific** — Clear, detailed prompts reduce back-and-forth
- **Make focused changes** — Smaller, single changes cost less than large rewrites
- **Use daily credits** — Experiment with your daily credits before using permanent ones
- **Iterate wisely** — Plan your changes to minimize unnecessary regenerations

## FAQ

**Do credits expire?**

Purchased credits are permanent and never expire. Monthly subscription credits carry over for 1 month if unused. Daily credits expire after 24 hours.

**What happens if I run out of credits mid-generation?**

The current generation will complete. You'll need to add credits before making further changes.

**How is credit cost calculated?**

Credits are based on AI token usage with a small margin. More complex requests that require more AI processing cost more credits.
