# Tips & Best Practices

Get the most out of Website2AI with these tips and best practices.

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Be Specific

The more details you provide, the better the results.

**Less effective:**
```
Make me a website
```

**More effective:**
```
Create a modern portfolio website for a UX designer. Include:
- A hero section with my name and tagline
- A projects gallery with 6 cards showing project thumbnails
- An about section with my photo and bio
- A skills section showing my expertise
- A contact form
Use a minimalist design with a dark theme and purple accents.
```

### Describe the Structure

Explicitly mention the sections and layout you want:

```
Create a landing page with these sections in order:
1. Hero with headline, subheadline, and CTA button
2. Features section with 3 cards
3. How it works - 3 step process
4. Testimonials carousel
5. Pricing table with 3 tiers
6. FAQ accordion
7. Footer with links and newsletter signup
```

### Specify Visual Style

Include design preferences for better results:

```
Style preferences:
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Lots of white space
- Rounded corners on cards and buttons
- Subtle shadows for depth
- Sans-serif fonts
- Primary color: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Secondary color: #10B981 (green)
```

### Provide Examples

Reference existing websites or styles:

```
Create a pricing page similar to Stripe's pricing page - clean,
professional, with a comparison table and FAQ section below.
```

## Iterative Refinement

### Start Simple, Then Add

Begin with the basic structure, then add features:

1. **First prompt:** Basic layout and sections
2. **Second prompt:** Add specific content and styling
3. **Third prompt:** Refine interactions and details

### Make Focused Requests

Instead of requesting many changes at once:

**Less effective:**
```
Change the colors, add animations, fix the mobile layout,
add a new section, and update the fonts
```

**More effective:**
```
Change the primary color from blue to purple (#8B5CF6)
```

Then follow up with additional requests.

### Use Incremental Changes

Each modification creates a new version. Use this to your advantage:

1. Make a change
2. Preview the result
3. If you don't like it, request a different approach
4. Keep the version you prefer

## Content Guidelines

### Provide Real Content

Use actual content when possible instead of placeholders:

```
About section content:
"Hi, I'm Sarah Chen, a product designer with 8 years of experience
creating intuitive digital experiences. I've worked with startups
and Fortune 500 companies to bring their visions to life."
```

### Specify Image Requirements

Be clear about image needs:

```
Hero image: A professional photo of a modern office space,
bright and airy with plants
```

### Include Call-to-Actions

Don't forget to specify your CTAs:

```
Primary CTA button: "Start Free Trial"
Secondary CTA: "Watch Demo"
```

## Performance Tips

### Keep It Focused

Websites with a clear purpose perform better:

- Single landing page > complex multi-page site
- Focused content > everything on one page
- Specific features > generic catch-all

### Mobile-First Thinking

Mention mobile requirements explicitly:

```
Ensure the design works well on mobile:
- Hamburger menu on small screens
- Stack cards vertically on mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px)
```

### Optimize for Speed

Request optimization when needed:

```
Keep the page lightweight - avoid heavy animations
and large images. Prioritize fast load times.
```

## Common Patterns

### Landing Pages

```
Create a SaaS landing page with:
- Hero: Headline, description, email signup, product screenshot
- Social proof: Logo bar of client companies
- Features: 3-4 key features with icons
- How it works: Step-by-step process
- Testimonials: 2-3 customer quotes with photos
- Pricing: 3-tier pricing table
- CTA: Final call-to-action section
- Footer: Links, social icons, newsletter
```

### Portfolio Sites

```
Create a portfolio for a [profession] with:
- Hero: Name, title, brief intro
- Work: Grid of projects with thumbnails
- About: Photo, bio, background
- Skills/Services: What you offer
- Contact: Form or contact information
```

### Business Websites

```
Create a website for [business type]:
- Hero: What we do, key value proposition
- Services: What we offer
- About: Company story, team
- Testimonials: Client reviews
- Contact: Form, location, hours
```

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Taking Too Long

- Simplify your request
- Break it into smaller parts
- Check your internet connection

### Results Don't Match Expectations
