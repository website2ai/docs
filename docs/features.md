- **Instant preview** - Preview updates in real-time as code is generated
- **Build status** - Track compilation and deployment progress

### Production-Ready Code

Website2AI generates modern, clean code:

### AI Model

Website2AI uses **GPT-5.2**, the latest and most capable model for website generation. It excels at understanding complex requirements and generating high-quality, production-ready code.

## Chat-Based Editing

### Iterative Modifications

After your initial website is created, chat with the AI to refine it:

```
Add a newsletter signup form to the footer
```

```
Make the hero section taller with a gradient background
```

```
Change all buttons to have rounded corners and a hover effect
```

### Context-Aware Changes

The AI remembers your entire project. Ask for changes that build on previous work:

```
Use the same color scheme from the header in the pricing section
```

```
Add another testimonial card like the existing ones
```

## Version History

### Automatic Versioning

Every modification creates a new version:

- **Version tracking** - Each change is saved as a new version
