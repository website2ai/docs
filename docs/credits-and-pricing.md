# Credits & Pricing

Website2AI uses a credit-based system that gives you flexibility in how you use the platform.

## How Credits Work

Credits are the currency for generating and modifying websites on Website2AI.

### Credit Consumption

Credits are consumed based on AI usage. The cost varies depending on:

- **Complexity** — Simple text changes cost less than full page generation
- **AI model** — Different models have different costs
- **Image generation** — AI-generated images cost additional credits
- **Token usage** — More complex prompts and outputs use more credits

### Credit Types

Website2AI has two types of credits:

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Permanent Credits** | Never expire. From signup bonus, purchases, and monthly grants. |
| **Daily Credits** | Expire after 24 hours. Refreshed daily at midnight UTC. |

**Usage priority:** Daily credits are consumed first, then permanent credits.

## FAQ

**Do purchased credits expire?**

No, purchased credits and monthly subscription credits are permanent and never expire. Only daily credits expire after 24 hours.

**What happens if I run out of credits mid-generation?**

The current generation will complete. You'll need to add credits before making further changes.

**Can I get a refund on unused credits?**

Contact support@website2.ai for refund requests. Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis.

**Why do daily credits expire?**

Daily credits encourage regular use and exploration. They're a bonus on top of your permanent credits.

**How is credit cost calculated?**

Credits are based on AI token usage with a small margin. More complex requests that require more AI processing cost more credits.
