# Welcome to Website2AI

Website2AI transforms your ideas into fully functional websites using AI. Describe what you want in plain English, and watch your website come to life.

## What is Website2AI?

Website2AI is an AI-powered platform that generates production-ready React websites from natural language descriptions. No coding required.

**How it works:**

1. **Describe** — Tell the AI what you want to build
2. **Generate** — Watch your website being created in real-time
3. **Refine** — Chat to make changes and improvements
4. **Deploy** — Your site is instantly live and shareable

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Generation
Describe your website in plain English. Our AI understands your intent and generates clean, modern code using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

### Real-Time Preview
See your website being built as the AI generates code. No waiting for builds or deployments — it's live as you work.

### Chat-Based Editing
Refine your website through conversation. Ask for changes like "make the header sticky" or "add a contact form" and see updates instantly.

### Version History (Coming Soon)
Every change will create a new version. You'll be able to browse your history and restore any previous version with one click.

### Instant Deployment
Your website is automatically deployed to a global CDN. Share your unique URL immediately, or connect your own domain.

### Production-Ready Code
Generated websites use modern technologies:
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Vite for fast builds
- Mobile-responsive by default

## Who Is This For?

- **Small businesses** — Create professional websites without hiring developers
- **Designers** — Turn mockups into working prototypes
- **Marketers** — Build campaign pages and promotional sites
