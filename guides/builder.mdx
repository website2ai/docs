## Writing Effective Prompts

### Be Specific

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="❌ Too Vague">
    "Make a website"

    "Create something cool"

    "Build an app"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="✅ Clear & Specific">
    "Create a portfolio website with a hero section, about page, project gallery, and contact form"

    "Build a todo app with categories, due dates, and dark mode"

    "Make a product landing page with features section, pricing tiers, and customer testimonials"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Provide Context

Good prompts include:

- **Purpose**: What the website is for
- **Key Features**: Main functionality needed
- **Style Preferences**: Design direction
- **Technologies**: Specific libraries if needed

<CodeGroup>

```text Good Example
Create a modern portfolio website for a freelance designer.
Include:
- Hero section with name and tagline
- Project gallery with filtering by category
- About section with skills
- Contact form
Use a clean, minimalist design with lots of white space
```

```text Better Example
Build a task management app similar to Todoist.
Features:
- Add/edit/delete tasks
- Categories and tags
- Due dates with calendar
- Dark mode toggle
- Drag and drop to reorder

Design: Modern, clean interface with subtle animations
Colors: Blue primary, dark mode with slate background
```

</CodeGroup>

## Making Changes

### Iterative Improvements

Once your initial website is generated, you can refine it:

```
"Add a newsletter signup form to the footer"
```

```
"Make the hero section taller and add a background gradient"
```

```
"Change the primary color from blue to purple"
```

```
"Add smooth scroll animations"
```

### Major Changes

For bigger changes, be specific about what to modify:

```
"Replace the grid layout in the features section with a carousel"
```

```
"Redesign the pricing section with comparison table instead of cards"
```

```
"Add a dashboard page with charts showing user statistics"
```

## Understanding Progress

### Generation Steps

When AI builds your website, you'll see these phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Planning">
    AI analyzes your prompt and plans the file structure

    **You'll see**: "Planning 12 files..."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Type System">
    Creates TypeScript interfaces for all components

    **You'll see**: "Creating type definitions..."
  </Step>

  <Step title="File Generation">
    Generates each file (happens in parallel)

    **You'll see**:
    - ✓ package.json
    - ✓ src/App.tsx
    - ✓ src/components/Header.tsx
    - ...
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete">
    All files generated and ready

    **You'll see**: "✨ Generation complete!"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Progress Indicators

- **Green checkmarks**: File completed
- **Spinning icon**: Currently generating
- **Error icon**: Generation failed (retry or rephrase)

## Browsing Generated Code

### File Tree

Click any file in the tree to view its code:

- **Blue files**: Currently selected
- **Folder icons**: Expand/collapse directories
- **Search**: Find files by name

### Code Viewer

When viewing a file:

- **Syntax highlighting**: Color-coded TypeScript/CSS/JSON
- **Line numbers**: Easy reference
- **Copy button**: Copy entire file or selected text
- **Download**: Get individual file

## Preview Controls

### Responsive Testing

Toggle between device sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full width (1920px)
- **Tablet**: iPad size (768px)
- **Mobile**: iPhone size (375px)

Your generated website is automatically responsive!

### Refresh Preview

If preview doesn't update:

1. Click the **refresh icon**
2. Wait a few seconds
3. Changes should appear

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Then Iterate">
    Don't try to describe everything in one prompt.

    **Step 1**: "Create a landing page with hero and features"

    **Step 2**: "Add pricing section"

    **Step 3**: "Add customer testimonials"

    **Step 4**: "Add FAQ section"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reference Examples">
    Mention websites you like:

    "Design similar to Linear's homepage"

    "Use a card layout like Airbnb"

    "Modern style like Stripe's website"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Specify Libraries">
    Want specific tools? Just ask:

    "Use Framer Motion for animations"

    "Include React Hook Form for the contact form"

    "Add charts using Recharts"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Version Control">
    Trying something experimental?

    Before making big changes, note your current version number. If you don't like the result, you can revert.
  </Accordion>

## Common Issues

### Preview Not Updating

**Solution**: Click the refresh button in preview panel

### Generation Taking Too Long

**Normal time**: 30-90 seconds

**If longer**: Check your internet connection or try refreshing the page

### Code Has Errors

**Solution**: Describe the issue to AI:

```
"The submit button isn't working, please fix it"
```

```
"There's a TypeScript error in Header.tsx"
```
