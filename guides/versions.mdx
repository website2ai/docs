## What Are Versions?

Every time you make a change to your website, website2ai creates a new **version**. Think of versions as snapshots of your project at different points in time.

- **v1**: Your initial website
- **v2**: After adding dark mode
- **v3**: After changing colors
- **v4**: After adding animations

Each version is complete and independent - you can always go back to any previous version.

## Why Use Versions?

### Experiment Safely

Try different approaches without losing your work:

```
Current version (v3): Clean, minimal design

Try: "Make it more colorful with gradients"
→ Creates v4

Don't like it? Just go back to v3!
```

### Track Progress

See how your website evolved:

1. v1: Basic structure
2. v2: Added features section
3. v3: Added pricing
4. v4: Final polish

### A/B Testing

Try different versions of the same feature:

```
v3: Hero with video background
v4: Hero with image slider (branched from v2)
v5: Hero with animated text (branched from v2)

Compare all three and pick the best!
```

## Viewing Versions

### In the Builder

Click the **version dropdown** in the top bar:

- See all versions with their numbers
- Each shows the prompt that created it
- Current version is highlighted

### Version List

```
✓ v4 - Add smooth scroll animations (current)
  v3 - Change colors to blue theme
  v2 - Add dark mode toggle
  v1 - Create a landing page...
```

Click any version to switch to it.

## Switching Versions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Version Dropdown">
    In the top bar, click the version number (e.g., "v4")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Version">
    Choose which version to view from the list
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview Loads">
    The selected version appears in the preview panel
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Switching versions only **views** the old version - it doesn't delete newer versions!
</Warning>

## Creating Versions

### Linear History (Default)

When you make changes, website2ai creates the next version:

```
v1 → v2 → v3 → v4
```

**Example:**

- Start: v1 (basic landing page)
- Chat: "Add pricing section" → Creates v2
- Chat: "Add testimonials" → Creates v3
- Chat: "Make it darker" → Creates v4

Each version builds on the previous one.

### Branching (Advanced)

Want to try different approaches? Branch from an earlier version:

```
        ┌─ v3 (try blue theme)
v1 ─ v2 ┤
        └─ v4 (try dark theme)
```

**How to branch:**

1. Switch to the version you want to branch from (e.g., v2)
2. Make your change: "Try a blue color scheme"
3. This creates v3 based on v2, not the latest version

## Version Comparison

While website2ai doesn't have a built-in visual diff tool, you can:

1. **Open two tabs**: View different versions side-by-side
2. **Download both**: Compare code locally
3. **Check file tree**: See which files changed

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Fresh for Major Changes">
    For complete redesigns, consider starting a new project instead of creating v20.

    Versions are best for **iterations**, not complete overhauls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Prompts">
    Your prompts become version descriptions!

    **Bad**: "Change it"

    **Good**: "Add dark mode toggle to header"

    **Great**: "Replace hero video with animated gradient background"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Branch for Experiments">
    Trying something risky? Branch from your stable version:

    1. Note current version (e.g., v5 is good)
    2. Make risky change → creates v6
    3. Don't like it? Go back to v5
    4. Try different approach → creates v7 from v5
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clean Up Unused Versions">
    Too many versions? Delete ones you won't use.

    (Feature coming soon!)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example Workflows

### Iterative Improvement

Building a landing page step by step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="v1: Foundation">
    ```
    Create a landing page for a productivity app
    ```

    Basic structure with hero and CTA
  </Step>

  <Step title="v2: Add Features">
    ```
    Add a features section with 4 features
    ```

    Now includes features grid
  </Step>

  <Step title="v3: Pricing">
    ```
    Add pricing section with 3 tiers
    ```

    Complete with pricing
  </Step>

  <Step title="v4: Polish">
    ```
    Add animations and improve spacing
    ```

    Production-ready!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Trying Alternatives

Want to test different designs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Base (v1)">
    ```
    Create a portfolio homepage
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try Option A (v2)">
    ```
    Use a grid layout for projects
    ```

    Grid-based design
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try Option B (v3)">
    Switch back to v1, then:

    ```
    Use a masonry layout for projects
    ```

    Masonry-based design (also based on v1)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pick Winner">
    Preview v2 and v3, choose the best one, continue from there
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Version Numbers

### Auto-Incrementing

Version numbers increment automatically:

- First generation: **v1**
- Second generation: **v2**
- Third generation: **v3**

You don't choose the number - website2ai handles it!

### Non-Linear Numbers

If you branch, numbers might not be sequential:

```
v1 → v2 → v5 (latest)
       ↘ v3 (branch)
       ↘ v4 (branch)
```

This is normal! The number shows **order created**, not linear history.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete a version?">
    Not yet, but this feature is coming soon!

    For now, all versions are saved. You can ignore ones you don't need.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do versions count against storage?">
    Each version stores complete code, but storage is unlimited on all plans.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I merge versions?">
    No automatic merging yet.

    **Workaround**: Describe what you want:

    "Combine the hero section from v2 with the features from v3"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know which version is deployed?">
    Versions are for development only. When you download, you choose which version to deploy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I name versions?">
    Not currently - versions use numbers only. Use descriptive prompts so you remember what each version contains!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tips for Power Users

### Quick Comparison

Want to compare two versions quickly?

1. Open website2ai in two browser windows
2. Switch to v3 in one, v5 in the other
3. Compare side-by-side

### Version Tags (Workaround)

Since you can't name versions, use this trick:

```
v1: "Create landing page"
v2: "Add pricing - MILESTONE: Ready for review"
v3: "Try blue colors - EXPERIMENT"
v4: "Final design - PRODUCTION"
```

Use keywords in prompts to mark important versions!

### Rollback Strategy

1. **Before experiments**: Note current version number
2. **Make changes**: Creates new versions
3. **Don't like it**: Switch back to noted version
4. **Continue**: Make new changes from stable version

## Real Example

Here's how a real project might evolve:

```
v1: "Create a SaaS landing page for an email tool"
    → Basic hero + features + CTA

v2: "Add pricing section with 3 tiers"
    → Added pricing

v3: "Add customer testimonials carousel"
    → Added testimonials

v4: "Make the design more modern with gradients"
    → Visual refresh

v5: "Try a different hero layout" (branched from v2)
    → Alternative design

v6: "Add FAQ section" (continued from v4)
    → Final version

Result: v6 is production-ready!
```
