## Local Development

Preview your documentation changes locally before deploying.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Install Mintlify

Install the Mintlify CLI to preview the documentation:

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

### Run the development server

Navigate to your docs directory and run:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

Your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and how to fix them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mintlify is not loading">
    Update to the latest version:
    ```bash
    mintlify install
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Port 3000 is already in use">
    Specify a different port:
    ```bash
    mintlify dev --port 3001
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deployment

Changes pushed to the main branch are automatically deployed by Mintlify.
