## Welcome to website2ai

**website2ai** is an AI-powered platform that transforms your ideas into production-ready React websites with TypeScript. Built with cutting-edge technology, it combines intelligent code generation with real-time streaming updates to deliver a seamless development experience.

### Key Features

- **Two-Phase Generation**: Intelligent architecture that creates a complete TypeScript type system first, then generates files in parallel for maximum speed and consistency
- **Real-time Streaming**: Watch your website being built file-by-file with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Version Control**: Built-in versioning system to track iterations and branch from any previous version
- **Live Preview**: Instant Sandpack-powered preview as you generate code
- **Production-Ready**: TypeScript-based React projects that compile without errors

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui
- Sandpack for live code preview
- Real-time SSE updates

**Backend:**
- FastAPI with async support
- PostgreSQL for persistence
- Redis for real-time pub/sub
- Celery for parallel task processing
- OpenAI for intelligent code generation

## How It Works

1. **Describe Your Vision**: Tell the AI what website you want to build
2. **AI Planning**: System plans the project structure and TypeScript interfaces
3. **Parallel Generation**: Files are generated in parallel with real-time updates
4. **Live Preview**: See your website come to life instantly
5. **Iterate & Refine**: Make changes and create new versions on the fly
